# Discriminator-Weighted Offline Imitation Learning from Suboptimal Demonstrations

This is the code for reproducing the results of the paper Discriminator-Weighted Offline Imitation Learning from Suboptimal Demonstrations accepted at ICML'2022. The paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06860).

### Usage
Paper results were collected with [MuJoCo 1.50](http://www.mujoco.org/) (and [mujoco-py 1.50.1.1](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py)) in [OpenAI gym 0.17.0](https://github.com/openai/gym) with the [D4RL datasets](https://github.com/rail-berkeley/d4rl). Networks are trained using [PyTorch 1.4.0](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and Python 3.6.

The paper results can be reproduced by running:
```
./run_experiments.sh
```
